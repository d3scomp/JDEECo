JDEECo is a Java implementation of the DEECo component system. For further information, please visit [http://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/projects/components_and_services/deeco/](http://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/projects/components_and_services/deeco/).

##Requirements
To compile and run the JDEECo framework, the following software has to be available on your system:

* Java SDK >= 1.8.0 ([http://java.com/en/](http://java.com/en/))

## Compilation and Deployment
To compile the project you will need to have Apache Maven (http://maven.apache.org/) installed on your machine (version 3.1.1 was used when writing the script).

#### There are two ways you can compile the sources using maven:
 * `default` - produces both simple jar and the OSGi bundle for jDEECo core library and demos
 * `OSGi` - produces OSGi bundle for jDEECo core
 * `core` - produces the simple jar for jDEECo

The `default` compilation is performed by simply executing `mvn clean install` command in the `jdeeco-parent` subfolder.
In order to compile sources to have OSGi bundle of jDEECo on outcome `mvn clean install` command in the `jdeeco-core-osgi` subfolder. To get just the simple jar one needs to run `mvn clean install` in the `jdeeco-core`.
All generated binaries along with dependencies needed to run jdeeco are placed in the `dist` folder.

## Tutorial
A jDEECo tutorial featuring a simple convoy example can be found as a separate project at https://github.com/d3scomp/JDEECo-Convoy-Tutorial. 

## Project structure

####Binaries
All binaries for jDEECo can be found in directory `dist`, which is created automatically in the root folder. Even if a specific part of jDEECo is built binaries will appear there (also could be found in projects `target` folder).

#### Build All
The universal build script is situated in `jdeeco-parent`. Running this script builds jDEECo in all available configurations along with demos.

#### OSGI support
To build jDEECo as an OSGi bundle, you run `mvn clean install` in `jdeeco-core-osgi`.

#### Core
To build jDEECo core you need to go to `jdeeco-core` folder and run `mvn clean install`. This will build jDEECo along with tests and produce the jDEECo jar.

#### Demos
Demo projects for jdeeco can be found in `jdeeco-demos` folder. There are two projects: the cloud case study based one, and one concerning firefighters case study. They can be built either by running `mvn clean install` in jdeeco-demos or via running the same command from `jdeeco-parent` (this will eventually generate all the binaries, as mentioned before). In both cases binaries `cloud.jar` and `firefighters.jar` will appear in `dist` folder along with an ant script to run them. There are 5 different demos out of those two projects

##### Cloud demos
* ant LocalLauncherCloud
* ant LocalLauncherDynamicCloud
* ant TSLauncherCloud

###### Firefighters demos
* ant FFLauncher
* ant FFHexacopterLauncher

## Eclipse integration
All of the projects in the repository are the Eclipse projects. As such they can be easily imported to the Eclipse workspace.

#### CDEECo
Apart from Java version of DEECo, there is its C++ realization that can be found under: ([http://github.com/d3scomp/CDEECo](http://github.com/d3scomp/CDEECo))
