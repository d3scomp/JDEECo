 * Scheduler is the abstract base class for all kinds of schedulers which organize

 * <p>
 * Common scheduler interface consists of the following methods
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>{@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.deeco.scheduler.Scheduler#start <code>start</code>} - Starts the scheduler
 * 	<li>{@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.deeco.scheduler.Scheduler#stop <code>stop</code>} - Stops the scheduler
 * 	<li>{@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.deeco.scheduler.Scheduler#addTask <code>addTask</code>} - Adds a task to the scheduler
 * 	<li>{@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.deeco.scheduler.Scheduler#removeTask <code>removeTask</code>} - Removes a task from the scheduler
 *	<li>{@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.deeco.scheduler.Scheduler#executionFailed <code>executionFailed</code>} - Notifies the scheduler that task was completed with an error
 * 	<li>{@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.deeco.scheduler.Scheduler#executionCompleted <code>executionCompleted</code>} - Notifies the scheduler that task was completed 
 * 	<li>{@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.deeco.scheduler.Scheduler#setExecutor <code>setExecutor</code>} - Assigns an {@link cz.cuni.mff.d3s.deeco.executor.Executor#Executor <code>Executor</code>}
 * 		instance to the scheduler
