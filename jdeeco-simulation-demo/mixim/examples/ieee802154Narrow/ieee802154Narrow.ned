//
//This example shows how to use MiXiMs implementation of the ieee802154
//narrow band protocol.
//
//The network consist of the "WorldUtilityStats" which extends from 
//BaseWorldUtility to collect some global statistics as well as the 
//usual ConnectionManager and a number of host.
//The hosts contain a special Traffic generation layer which lies 
//directly above the NIC which moreover consist of the "csma"-mac 
//layer module and the PhyLayer. The PhyLayer uses "Decider802154Narrow"
//as a decider.
//
//There are three "Test"s which try to show the characteristics of the
//used csma mac layer. For each of these tests exists a "runTestX.sh" 
//script as well as a "TestX.anf" file which execute the configurations 
//necessary to produce the result-files for the according "*.anf" file.
//So you can take a look at the result of these tests by calling the 
//"runTestX.sh" script and then opening the according "TestX.anf" file.
//
//------------------------------
//Test 1
//
//This configuration produces the usage statistics of the channel for 
//different parameters. Usage statistics means how much of the 
//channels possible maximum capacity is used at which amount of generated
//traffic.
//
//The results of this tests are visualized by "Test1.anf" and show plots 
//of the generated traffic against the received traffic where both values
//are normalized against bitrate and simulation time.
//If everything was fine this should plot 5 lines which converge with
//different speeds to a channel usage of about 0.8 (depending on the used 
//parameters).
//You also might see strange outliers in a few of these lines. These seem
//to be caused by wrong reading of the output scalars. The outliers are not
//present in the actual output scalars. You can read and plot the output 
//scalars using matlab to verify this.
//
//------------------------------
//Test 2
//
//These test configurations are meant to show the effect of MAC-ACKS on the
//usage of the channel with increasing distance between the hosts.
//Test2-C further shows the effect of the hidden station problem on CSMA.
//
//The results can be visualized by "Test2.anf" and show plots of channel 
//usage at different distances.
//The graph shows three lines plotting the channel usage against the distance
//between the nodes. You should see that channel usage begins to decrease
//rapidly around a distance of 170 metres. Whereas the run with MAC-Acks 
//enabled should begin decreasing later than the run without.
//The third line shows the performance in the hidden station scenario. It
//should show a huge performance decrease at a distance around 120 metres.
//This is the point where the two senders are not in range of each other
//anymore and begin to interfere each others transmissions to the receiver.
//
//-----------------------------
//Test 3
//
//This tests is meant to show that CSMA uses exponential backoffs. This is 
//done by increasing the number of hosts in the network exponentially.
//While the average backoff duration of each hosts should increase
//exponentially, the average number of backoffs should increase linearly.
//
//The results of this tests are visualized by "Test3.anf".
//It should show four bar charts displaying the following parameters for 
//each run.
//- Chart 1 - average number of transmitted frames per node.
//			  These bars should be between 5 and 10 frames per node.
//- Chart 2 - average number of backoffs per node.
//			  These bars should increase almost linear with each run. This results
//			  from the exponential backoffs.
//- Chart 3 - average time spent in backoff per node.
//			  These bars should increase exponential with each run.
//- Chart 4 - amount of nodes present.
//			  These bars should increase exponential 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
