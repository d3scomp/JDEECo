//
//This example shows how to use MiXiMs CSMA protocol implementation.
//
//The network consists of a number of hosts which represent some kind of switches
//and a number of hosts which represent clients. At first they build up their
//routing tables by sending, forwarding (only switches), receiving and
//evaluating "Hello World" messages. After that phase the clients start randomly
//"jabbering" with other hosts and the switches only forward the "Jabber"
//messages to their destination.
//
//The phy layer uses only "SimplePathlossModel" as AnalogueModel and 
//"SNRThresholdDecider" as Decider.
//
//The omnetpp.ini contains the following configurations:
//
//- "General" 			- three clients in range of each other, no switch, no 
//						  propagation	delay
//- "WithoutPropDelay" 	- four clients and two switches whereas the switches are
//						  in range of each other and the clients are in range of at
//						  least one switch, no propagation delay
//- "WithPropDelay"		- same but with propagation delay
//- "CollissionMac"		- same configuration but the parameters for the CSMAMacLayer
//						  lead to more collisions
//- "Perftest"			- used with CmdEnv for performance testing (time limited)
//
